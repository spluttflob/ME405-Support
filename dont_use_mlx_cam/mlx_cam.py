@file mlx_cam.py
This file contains a wrapper that facilitates the use of a Melexis MLX90640
thermal infrared camera for general use. The wrapper contains a class MLX_Cam
whose use is greatly simplified in comparison to that of the base class,
@c class @c MLX90640, by mwerezak, who has a cool fox avatar, at
@c https://github.com/mwerezak/micropython-mlx90640

To use this code, upload the directory @c mlx90640 from mwerezak with all its
contents to the root directory of your MicroPython device, then copy this file
to the root directory of the MicroPython device.

There's some test code at the bottom of this file which serves as a beginning
example.

        @brief   Show low-resolution camera data as shaded pixels on a text
                 screen.
        @details The data is printed as a set of characters in columns for the
                 number of rows in the camera's image size. This function is
                 intended for testing an MLX90640 thermal infrared sensor.

                 A pair of extended ACSII filled rectangles is used by default
                 to show each pixel so that the aspect ratio of the display on
                 screens isn't too smushed. Each pixel is colored using ANSI
                 terminal escape codes which work in only some programs such as
                 PuTTY.  If shown in simpler terminal programs such as the one
                 used in Thonny, the display just shows a bunch of pixel
                 symbols with no difference in shading (boring).

                 A simple auto-brightness scaling is done, setting the lowest
                 brightness of a filled block to 0 and the highest to 255. If
                 there are bad pixels, this can reduce contrast in the rest of
                 the image.

                 After the printing is done, character color is reset to a
                 default of medium-brightness green, or something else if
                 chosen.
