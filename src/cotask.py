## @file cotask.py
#  This file contains classes to run cooperatively scheduled tasks in a
#  multitasking system.
#
#  Tasks are created as generators, functions which have infinite loops and call
#  @c yield at least once in the loop. References to all the tasks to be run
#  in the system are kept in a list maintained by class @c CoTaskList; the 
#  system scheduler then runs the tasks' @c run() methods according to a 
#  chosen scheduling algorithm such as round-robin or highest-priority-first.

## Implements multitasking with scheduling and some performance logging.
#
#  This class implements behavior common to tasks in a cooperative 
#  multitasking system which runs in MicroPython. The ability to be scheduled
#  on the basis of time or an external software trigger or interrupt is 
#  implemented, state transitions can be recorded, and run times can be
#  profiled. The user's task code must be implemented in a generator which
#  yields the state (and the CPU) after it has run for a short and bounded 
#  period of time. 
#
#  @b Example:
#    @code
#       def task1_fun ():
#            '''! This function switches states repeatedly for no reason '''
#            state = 0
#            while True:
#                if state == 0:
#                    state = 1
#                elif state == 1:
#                    state = 0
#                yield (state)
# 
#        # In main routine, create this task and set it to run twice per second
#        task1 = cotask.Task (task1_fun, name = 'Task 1', priority = 1, 
#                             period = 500, profile = True, trace = True)
#
#        # Add the task to the list (so it will be run) and run scheduler
#        cotask.task_list.append (task1)

## A list of tasks used internally by the task scheduler.
#  This class holds the list of tasks which will be run by the task scheduler.
#  The task list is usually not directly used by the programmer except when
#  tasks are added to it and the scheduler is called. An example showing the
#  use of the task list is given in the last few lines of the documentation
#  for class @c Task. 
# 
#  The task list is sorted by priority so that the scheduler can efficiently
#  look through the list to find the highest priority task which is ready to
#  run at any given time. Tasks can also be scheduled in a simpler
#  "round-robin" fashion.

        #  that priority.
